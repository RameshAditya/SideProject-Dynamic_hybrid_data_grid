# Dynamic Hybrid Data Grid

An algorithm which allowed for read-and-write of data in a dynamic grid, that allocated memory in runtime and facilitated faster access to data via 2-dimensional maneuvering. 

Applications involve but are not limited to - 
• Storing security feeds classified on a daily basis 
• Storing logs sorted and classified by date 
• Any consistently generated data inherently ordered or required to be ordered
