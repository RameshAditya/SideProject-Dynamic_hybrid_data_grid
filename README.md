# Dynamic Hybrid Data Grid

An algorithm which allows for faster read-and-write of data in a dynamic grid, that allocates memory in runtime and facilitates an improvement in access of data due to 2-dimensional maneuvering. 

Applications involve but are not limited to
* Storing security feeds classified on a daily basis 
* Storing logs sorted and classified by date 
* Any consistently generated data inherently ordered or required to be ordered
